# Microstructure-Reconstruction-through-2-point-statistics
A means of expanding the microstructure database
For the initial microstructure directly obtained from the EBSD result, the pre-processing is used to clean up. Also for the generated microstructure, the post-processing is required to "simulate" the grain morphology. Both of these 2 processings are based on anisotropic voronoi method.
